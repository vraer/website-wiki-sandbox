These files are named after their triggers. For example, in the below snippet, the GHA triggers on a pull request that is either opened, closed, or edited.</p> Note on wr-pull-request-trigger.yml  The wr-pull-request-trigger.yml file is based on a workflow run trigger. This trigger basically means \"run this after this GHA finished running\". Sometimes this is used if the results of one or more past actions can be further used to perform an additional task. For example, pull request triggers can often be dangerous since it runs in the context of the repository that made the pull request, a context that a user have limited controlled. The workflow run trigger moves the context into the repository that the pull request is trying to merge into. For more information on security, take a look at the tips below for articles on security!  Note on the other files  The other files in that folder are GHAs that has not yet been incorporated into issue-trigger.yml, lint-scss.yml, or pull-request-trigger.yml. These files, depending on their triggering condition, should eventually be refactored into them (in fact, there are probably issues on them if you type in 'refactoring ghas' in the issue search bar.  Note on the scheduled triggers  Based on our naming scheme, you might be wondering about how we name scheduled triggers. Although there are currently files that work on a scheduled trigger, they had not been renamed yet. For those files, they should be named based on when they activate, such as \"Schedule Daily 1300\", \"Scheduled Monthly\", or \"Scheduled Friday 0700\".  <p><code>pull-request-trigger.yml</code></p> <pre><code>name: Pull Request Trigger\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, closed, edited]\n    branches:\n      - 'gh-pages'\n</code></pre> <p>Further more, these triggers are further subdivided through if-else clauses into different jobs, or actions that are taken when the trigger condition is fulfilled. In the below snippet, there are two overarching jobs: Add-Issue-Labels-To-PR and Add-Reviewers-To-New-PR. These jobs only activate when a pull request is opened. Once activated, they perform a series of instructions, called steps (which is not written out here to conserve space). These steps are usually written in <code>ubuntu</code> commandline code, which is a powerful language for file maintenance and manipulation (those familiar with commandline code will realize that GHAs are a lot like cron jobs).</p> <p><code>pull-request-trigger.yml</code></p> <pre><code>jobs:\n  Add-Issue-Labels-To-PR:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # Only trigger when a new PR is created\n    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull-request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'opened'}}\n    steps:\n      - run: echo \"Hello World! \ud83c\udf89\"\n      ...\n  Add-Reviewers-To-New-PR:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # Only trigger when a new PR is created\n    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull-request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'opened'}}\n    steps:\n      - run: echo \"Hello World! \ud83c\udf89\"\n      ...\n</code></pre> <p>To summarize, the thing to remember about these files are that they are named after triggers, and that each job uses if/else clauses to specify the specific trigger that causes the GHA to run.</p>"},{"location":"dev/github-actions/legacy/#github-actions-directory","title":"github-actions Directory","text":"<p>For most developers, the <code>ubuntu shell</code> is either too arcane or too lacking to perform very tailored actions. Therefore, we often abstract away the <code>ubuntu</code> code by running an external JS file instead. This external file, and all files that support it, lives in the second GHA directory: the github-actions directory.</p> <p>The github-actions directory houses all the JS files that are called or used by the .yml files in the .github/workflows. These files are usually called via two external modules called actions/checkout@v2 and actions/github-script@v4. Their functions will not be detailed here, as that can be found in their documentation. However, I will say that these two work in tandem to allow GHAs to call our JS files.</p> <p><code>issue-trigger.yml</code></p> <pre><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2      \n  - name: Check Labels\n    uses: actions/github-script@v4\n    id: check-labels\n    with:\n      script: |\n        const script = require('./github-actions/trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/check-labels.js')\n        const checkLabels = script({g: github, c: context})\n        return checkLabels\n  - name: Post Comment\n    uses: actions/github-script@v4\n    with:\n       script: |\n         const results = ${{ steps.check-labels.outputs.result }}\n         const script = require('./github-actions/trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/post-labels-comment.js')\n         script({g: github, c:context}, results)\n</code></pre> <p>In the above sample, you will notice that the script is called by giving it a github and context object. These two objects are provided by the actions/github-script@v4 module, respectively serving as an entryway into the GitHub API and the data containing the context of the trigger.</p> <p>Note how every step in the GHA has a name (above, the names are Check Labels and Post Comment). These names are there to broadly define the steps of that particular action.</p> <p>Also, note the path of the called JS files, trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/check-labels.js and trigger-issue/add-missing-labels-to-issues/check-labels.js. These paths follow the pattern of trigger/jobname/stepname.js. This organization allows us to very quickly locate the JS file that is associated with some action, and quickly surmise its purpose. This helps us edit the files quickly, since most GHAs involves very similar tasks, and so a very nested structure is needed to not confuse files such as add-update-label-weekly.js vs add-label-on-issue-creation.js.</p> <p>Jumping into the github-actions directory, you will see four main directories: trigger-issue, trigger-pr, trigger-schedule, and utils. The first three are related to the aforementioned triggers, while utils contains code that can be reused by multiple JS files in the trigger-* directories.</p> Note  The other folders have not yet been incorporated into the trigger-issue, trigger-pr, and trigger-schedule directories. These files, depending on their triggering condition, should eventually be refactored into them (in fact, there are probably issues on them if you type in 'refactoring ghas' in the issue search bar.  <p>To summarize, the important things to know about the github-actions directory is that they house the js and other files involving GHAs in a nested pattern, trigger/jobname/stepname.js, and that the js file is called by the yml files in the .github/workflows directory.</p> <p>Also, for those who are curious as to why the directory does not live inside .github: the .github folder is hidden, and so cannot be found when checkout is used.</p>"},{"location":"dev/github-actions/legacy/#mini-guide","title":"Mini-guide","text":"<p>This mini-guide details a very hacky way for making GHAs.

Are there any limits to what pull requests I can review?    &gt;Yes, we do have recommended guidelines for contributors when choosing which request to review. First, we recommend reviewing older rather than younger pull requests.

Project Languages While most information for a project is pulled from its markdown file, languages for projects are pulled from a project's Github API. See the project layout wiki. Project Contributors Similar to project languages, project contributors are also pulled from Github's list. Currently, the contributors list is showing members based on commits (individuals who have made more Github commits show up on top of the list). We are working on a way to use Github to also include members who contribute to discussions or project issues (i.e. UI/UX designers) without commiting code. See the project layout wiki. Action Network Hack for LA is currently using Action Network to collect and store an email subscription list for users who are interested in receiving updates from Hack for LA. The script for embedding the API into the sign up forms can be found in assets\\js\\api-actionnetwork.js. The script is using the DOM to create and embed Action Network into the signup form, and sending any submissions to Action Network. Hotjar Hotjar is a behavior analytics tool that we are using to analyze how visitors are interacting with the Hack for LA site. However, since the free tier of Hotjar provides 3 funnels, we are limited to tracking only Home page and the Getting Started page. We've also chosen to use Google Analytics in conjunction with Hotjar. The script for the Hotjar API can be found in the head.html file which sets the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> for every site page. Google Analytics Google Analytics is our primary tool for analyzing user interaction and traffic to the Hack for LA website. The script for the Google Analytics API can be found in the head.html file as well as the redirect.html layout file, to ensure that every page will be analyzed. Google Calendar Prior to Covid-19, we utilized Google Calendars to display recurring Hack Night events. Now that meetings and events are held remotely, the calendar is not being displayed. The script for embedding the Google Calendar can be found in assets\\js\\api-calendar.js."},{"location":"dev/site-architecture/duplicate-style-classes/","title":"Duplicate Style Classes","text":"<p>This guide provides the procedure for handling duplicate style classes by employing the bootstrap method of Standardized Components, which incorporates reusable styling components, like <code>_buttons.scss</code>, assigned to specific folders and applicable across multiple pages.
