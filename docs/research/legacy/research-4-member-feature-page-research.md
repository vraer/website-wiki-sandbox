# Member Feature Page Research

## Research Date: 
Started June 2021

## Summary of Research 

### Question
What do users, including recruiters and general volunteers, want to see on this page?


### Purpose
The Member Feature page aims to highlight certain job-ready volunteers at Hack for LA in a way that showcases their talent, personality, aspirations, and accomplishments. It can also serve as a platform for highlighting members from marginalized, underrepresented backgrounds. 

By featuring some of our driven volunteers, we open opportunities for recruiters to connect with socially conscious candidates with a glimpse of their personalities. Itâ€™s also a way for newcomers to get a view of what a stellar volunteer at Hack for LA looks like.
