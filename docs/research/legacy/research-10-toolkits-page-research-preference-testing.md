# Toolkits Page Research: Preference Testing

## Research Date

August 14, 2022

## Summary of Research

14/08/2022: Completed issue today via live preference test. Out of 17 voters, 14 displayed a preference towards Toolkit Dark bg - option 3. While the issue is complete, I also reached out to individuals with civic tech jobs to understand the way in which they conduct preference tests to help uncover if there are any ways to improve our current method. After speaking with them, it appears that while they have mot used Figjam, they have made us of Google Survey Forms instead.  

26/08/2022: I have spent the last few days playing around with Figjam to come up with a model that could (potentially) be used for preference testing moving forward. Currently, I have come up with 3 different models. After showing them to the team during our call, I have decided to wait until another Preference Test issue comes up so that I can test it.
