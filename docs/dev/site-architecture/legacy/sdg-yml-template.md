This is the template to be used for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) yml files in the _data/internal/sdgs directory. Here is an example file: [INSERT LINK TO EXAMPLE HERE]
```
# The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number (e.g. 16)
sdg:
# The color name of the SDG image. This is based on its associated color variable without the `$color-` portion.
color:
# The path to the SDG image
image:
# The alt text for the SDG image
image-alt:
targets:
  # The SDG target (e.g. 8) and its statement in key-value pair format.
  8: Broaden and strengthen the awareness and participation of City and local communities, especially those traditionally underserved and marginalized, in the institutions of local and global governance 
```

# Color
For example, SDG 16's color variable is $color-royalblue, so its color would be royalblue.  [NEED TO EXPLAIN WHERE THE VARIABLES ARE AND MAYBE HOW TO APPLY IT IN CODE.]
