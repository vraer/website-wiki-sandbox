1. Create HTML file in root folder with the name of your page

`yourPageName.html`

1. Create a sass stylesheet in `_sass/components` with the same name as your HTML file but with an underscore `_` at the beginning.

`_sass/components/_yourPageName.scss`

1. Import your pages stylesheet in to the main.scss stylesheet (located: `_sass/main.scss`) by adding this line of code under the component section in `main.scss`

`@import ‘components/yourPageName.scss’`

4. Create a folder within `assets/images` named exactly like your html file. Here you can place all the images you are using in this folder

`assets/images/yourPageName`

```js
<!-- Make sure to include the Jekyll Front Matter as the first thing in the file. Following the format below. -->
<!-- Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file.-->
