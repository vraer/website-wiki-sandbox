title: Wins page checklist
---

**Follow the steps outlined below when working on issues related to the Wins page.**
 
- [X] Check if the issue requires you to gain access to the [HfLA Website Admin Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ZHh3MTf4vmU9NPW1OViRQ4wvb8oGOoC), if yes, reach out to the leads requesting appropriate access permissions.
    - If you need to work on the how the data from json file is used by wins.js to display on the wins page, you might not need access to the HfLA Website Admin Folder, but if you need to work on anything related to how the json file is generated, you will probably need access to the folder. If you are not sure, please check with the leads.
- [X] Go through the [Wins form admin guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1JTX5XzotgVCVZ91ImvenedPN5-IVjdSKDukq1B9iE/edit) for detailed information on how the workflow (up until generation of the json file) is set up.
- [X] Make copies of all the files needed (from the HfLA Website Admin Folder) in your own drive and test out the code changes. No code change should be made to the production script.
    - To make a copy of a file, open the file. Then, select **File > Make a copy** and a _Copy Document_ modal should show up that allows you to name your copy of the file and choose the folder where the copy should go. For the _Folder_, make sure to change it to your own drive. Then, select **Make a copy** button.

_Once approved, the leads would add the code changes to the production script._
