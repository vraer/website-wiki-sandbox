Please update your issue with one of the following labels at all times. 

For Example, a developer was stuck and needed the help of other developers, so they added a Help Wanted label. 

Once they got the help, they removed the Help Wanted label and added the Needs Update label. 

After they do the update, the next thing they will do is remove the Needs Update label and add the Update added label.
