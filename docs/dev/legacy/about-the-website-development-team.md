- The Hack for LA Website Development Team is a level 1 team, which means the team has a support structure in place for all developers on the team to learn best practices before moving on to a level 2 team. In addition, this means all developers new to the team go through the same process.

- Our front end is HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. Our back end and development operations use GitHub Actions and Google Apps Script.

**Once you join our team, we expect all developers to do the following:**
- Require a time commitment of at least 6 hours per week, excluding vacations and weeks off.
  - Also, please let the tech leadership team know (through a Slack message in the hfla-site channel as well as an @ mention in a comment of the issue that you would be working on) if you are planning to take a week off or a longer vacation.
- Attend at least one of the following meetings each week:
  - All team weekly meeting (UX/UR, Development, Product), Sundays 10am-12 noon Pacific Time
  - Developer (front-end/back-end) weekly team meeting, Tuesdays 7-8 pm Pacific Time
  - (Optional) Developer Office Hours meeting, Thursdays 7-8pm Pacific Time

  In case, you are unable in any given week, you should reach out to the tech leadership team. Exceptions to this requirement may be provided on a case-by-case basis.
- Complete a pre-work developer checklist issue, which we will guide you through.
- Review pull requests, which we will teach you how to do.
- Work on one issue at a time and wait until your pull request is merged before working on another issue.
- Progress through issues with increasing complexity in the following order:
  - Good first issue
  - Good second issue
  - Small 
  - Medium 
  - Large
 
  The reasons for this progression are:
    - The issues start out as being prescriptive and become less so as you gain more experience by working through increasingly complex issues.
    - We are trying to teach you the team methodology through the issues themselves.
    - It ensures you understand what we expect and the quality of contributions.

- Also, please only do one good first issue, one good second issue, and one small issue.
  - This will ensure we have enough good first, good second, and small issues for newer developers to work on. 
  - Exceptions may be made for working on more than one small issue during the entirety of your time on the website team but please speak with a team lead with your reason for doing so, such as a medium issue being too difficult for you and you need to learn something new by doing a small issue as a stepping stone to help you progress to a medium issue.
